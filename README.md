## Update

This project has been discontinued. I have moved on from Kodi and I no longer have time to maintain this project. 

### About

I am an independent developer. I enjoy building Kodi addons that provide access to Free Live TV. I never charge for my addons. It is truly a labor of love.

### Getting started

To get started you should install my repo. Then you can install my addons from within Kodi using the "Install from repository" option.
