# m7_Kodi_Addons

Unofficial Kodi Addons for the Kodi Media Center - Kodi is a registered trademark of the XBMC Foundation. I am not connected to or in any other way affiliated with Kodi.

## Affiliation

I am an independent developer. I have chosen to be affiliated with [TVADDONS](https://www.tvaddons.co/) because they have always treated me with respect. I can't say the same for other organizations within the Kodi community. I do not earn a single dollar from any of my work. I do it because I enjoy it.

### Getting started

To get started with my addons you should install my repo. Then you can install my addons from within Kodi using the "Install from repository" option.
