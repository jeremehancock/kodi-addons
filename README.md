## Affiliation

I am an independent developer. I have chosen to be affiliated with [TVADDONS](https://www.tvaddons.co/) because they have always treated me with respect. I can't say the same for other organizations within the Kodi community. I do not earn a single dollar from any of my work. I do it because I enjoy it.

## Getting started
